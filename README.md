# Finetuning using Lamini

In this project I will develop a chatbot to generate SQL answers, combined with this we will perform a finetuning with the idea of reducing the token consumption and improving the quality of the result. We can make all of this more simple by using a platform such as Cohere or OpenAI, but in my case, I will use Lamini because it gives us the option of finetuning other LLMs such as Llama 3.

> **Disclaimer**
> In this project I will use the free tier of Lamini to make this project accessible to anyone interested in experimenting with Finetuning, in case of need for a production-ready app, I recommend using other platforms or upgrading to the paid tier to access more resources such as memory tuning to keep hallucinations almost 0 and with faster results.
