# finetuning_lamini
In this project I will develop a chatbot to generate SQL answers, combined with this we will perform a finetuning with the idea of reducing the token consumption and also improve the results quality. We can make all of this in a simpler way by using a platform such as Cohere or OpenAI, but in my case I will use Lamini
